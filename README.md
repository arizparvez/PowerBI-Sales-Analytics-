***AtliQ Hardware Power BI Project: A Step-by-Step Execution Plan:***

- Evaluate customers based on Net Sales, Gross Margin, and Gross Margin % to understand their overall contribution and profitability.
- Plot a scatter chart comparing Net Sales and Gross Margin, using Gross Margin % as a third dimension through bubble size or color intensity.
- Design a two-page scatter chart reportâ€”one focusing on market-level (country/region) performance and the other on customer-level details.
- Track performance trends across fiscal years 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 (including estimates), comparing both market and customer metrics year by year.
- Implement interactive dropdown slicers for country, region, and customer to enable dynamic filtering across the report.
- Construct a matrix with a tree-level hierarchy showing Segment, Category, and Product.
